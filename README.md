Book Exchange Website

## Project Description

This is a website my teammates and I are creating for one of our college classes.
The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for the studnets to purchase and exchange used textbooks.
Ideally, students should get a lower price for their textbooks while also getting a chance to socialize with those who took or are going to take the same class.
Not only that, through this website, students should be able to get some textbooks that are rather hard to find in their school bookstore or libraries since different professors might have different preferences when it comes to teaching materials.
